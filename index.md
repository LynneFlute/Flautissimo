Flautissimo is a friendly and welcoming group of flute players of all ages who rehearse weekly on Fridays in term time with Music Director, <a href="musicdirector"> Joanna Price</a>.  Rehearsals are held at Toynbee School, Chandlers Ford SO53 2PL. Members can also attend rehearsals via Zoom.

Piccolissimo meets from 6-7pm and is for players from beginner to Grade 5 and 'returning' players who want to rediscover the fun of flute playing.  

Flautissimo meets from 7-9pm and is for players of Grade 5+ standard.

We have regular [performances](https://lynneflute.github.io/Flautissimo/performances) in and around the Southampton area.
