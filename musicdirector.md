<p>Joanna Price has been Music Director of Flautissimo (and before that a playing member) for a number of years, and always looks forward to leading us to new success playing exciting new music. Joanna relishes the prospect of exploring new flute orchestra repertoire alongside old favourites. Jo was Principal Flute of both the Reading Youth Orchestra and the Berkshire Youth Orchestra, went on to study Music at the University of Manchester and followed her degree with a PGCE in Secondary Music teaching and a Licentiate in Instrumental teaching. Her high standard of playing has been acknowledged with various awards, including the Leon Goossens trophy at the Oxford Music Festival and the Proctor Gregg award for performance at university. Joanna has taught locally for over 10 years and also currently plays with Saxophony. Credits with local shows have recently included Jesus Christ Superstar, Beauty and the Beast and West Side Story. Among her many interests Joanna enjoys finding time to spend walking in the New Forest with her family, cycling and stand-up paddleboarding.</p>
