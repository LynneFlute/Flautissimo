## Previous Performances

- Flautissimo and Piccolissimo enjoyed playing in the summer sunshine at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens on Saturday 13 May 2023.  We entertained visitors to the gardens with a varied programme of music which included The Ash Groove, Single Yellow Line, To a Wild Rose and In The Hall of the Mountain King.  

- On Saturday 25 March, Flautissimo played at Southampton's West Quay shopping centre, a new venue for the orchestra.  Quite a crowd gathered to listen to us play and seemed to particularly enjoy the Sound of Music medley and Bohemian Rhapsody.
